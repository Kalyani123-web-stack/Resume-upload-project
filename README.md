# Resume-upload-project
Implemented a secure file upload system that allows users to upload resumes (PDF/DOCX) through a web interface or API. Uploaded files are stored in a media directory, and validations ensure file type and size compliance. Integrated with Django admin and REST endpoints for easy management.
